        <h2>Description</h2>
        Dip these into the alfredo sauce you probably just made!
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 cup warm water (105 to115 degrees F/40 to 45 degrees C)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon warm water (105 to115 degrees F/40 to 45 degrees C)</li>
            <li>3 cups bread flour</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons butter, melted, divided</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Dissolve sugar and yeast in 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon warm water in a bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Combine flour and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix 2 tablespoons butter into flour mixture until incorporated. Pour yeast mixture into flour mixture and knead dough using the dough hook attachment until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place dough in a container and cover with a towel or plastic wrap; let stand until doubled in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.</li>
            <li>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Divide dough into 2-ounce portions and roll into 7-inch long sticks. Arrange sticks on the prepared baking sheet; cover with plastic wrap and let stand until dough doubles in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Remove plastic wrap from dough.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until breadsticks are golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Brush each breadstick using remaining 2 tablespoons melted butter; top with garlic salt.</li>
        </ol>
